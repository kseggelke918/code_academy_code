# Like procs, lambdas are objects. The similarities donâ€™t stop there: 
# with the exception of a bit of syntax and a few behavioral quirks, 
# lambdas are identical to procs.

lambda { puts "Hello!" } 

# is just about the same as 

Proc.new { puts "Hello!" }

# syntax: 

lambda { |param| block }

symbolize = lambda {|x| x.to_sym}

# Write your code above this line!
