Java doesn't interpret whitespace.

Java DOES interpret semi colons - they are used to makr the end of a statement (1 line of code that performs a single tastk)

{} mark the scope of a class or method - don't put ; after {}

Guidelines for how to write Java programs: 
* Java programs have at least one class and one main() method
    - Each class represents one real-world idea
    - The main() method runs the tasks of the program
* Java comments add helpful context to human readers
* Java has whitespace, curly braces and semicolons
    - Whitespace is for humans to read code easily
    - {} mark the scope of a class & method 
    - ; mark the end of a statement
* Java is a compiled language 
    - Compiling catches mistakes in our code 
    - Compilers transform code into an executable class
