// All programs require one or more classes that act as a model for the world.

// ex) a progrm to track student test scores might have Student, Course, and Grade
// classes.  Our real-world concerns, students and grades, are inside the progran
// as classes.  Represent each student as an instance or object of the 
// Student class.  OBJECT ORIENTATED PROGRAMMING b/c programs are 
// built around objects and their interations.  An object contains
// state and behavior

// Methods - behavior 
// Fields - state

// Classes are a blueprint for objects - detail the general structure

// ex) all studetns have an ID.  THIS student has an ID of 42 and THIS course
// enrolled THAT student
